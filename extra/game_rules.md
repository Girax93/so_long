# Rules:

### Before the first 3 yomm's has been consumed:
* Empty floors/spaces will tell you which yomm's you can eat.

### After the 3 first yomm's has been consumed:
* You are now on a path. The direction in which you are going now will never change, unless you need to due to the following overriding rules:
	* Walls NEEDS to have 1 bad yomm, empty floor, or another wall next to it in every adjacent direction.
	* Empty floors can still point to yomm's, but those yomm's are not valid for the path.

<br>

**Yomm's**
* there are good and bad yomm's.

**Empty floors:**
* Shows where a yomm is, after connsecutive bad yomm's of equal length as the amount of empty floors. Aka:
		* 3 empty floors means that in the direction of the floors (horisontal or vertical) 3 bad yomms will be, and after that 1 good yomm.
* Yes, you can walk on empty floors.

**Walls**
* Walls ALWAYS has 1 bad yomm, empty floor, or another wall next to it in every adjacent direction.

<br>

### Hints:

* Empty floors can give a hint to where the path is as well. Remember that ALL yomms has to be collected before the hole opens.
* You never have to guess in this game.
* Try to figure out the entire path before walking it. It can get difficult to remember where you've been, or where you're going if there are no bad/good yomms to guide you.

**Dictionary:**
* Adjacent means above, under, to the left or to the right. NOT diagonally.

## For game/map makers:

When making a game make sure:
- [ ] Is there an indicator to WHERE the first 3 yomm's are, adjacent to the players starting position or a yomm?
- [ ] Remember that the THIRD yomm needs to point in a direction
